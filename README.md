 I'm a huge fan of Product Managements, Web 3 etheruem full stack development, Javascript, Node js and express, 
open-source, and writing testable software ðŸ’». When I'm not crushing bugs or building dreams, I can be found playing with family.
I love great software product which are done according to specifications from the users. Agile is my practice and scrum is my friend. 
I love building great web 3 projects and i will be happy to build yours.
